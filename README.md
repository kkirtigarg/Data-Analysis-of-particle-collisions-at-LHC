## Project: Exploring Beyond the Standard Model with High-Energy Physics

### Introduction and Motivation
- High-energy physics endeavours to understand fundamental nature through particle collisions at extreme energies.
- LHC experiments (ATLAS, CMS) amassed vast data; the Standard Model explains only 4% of the universe.
- Pursuit of physics models beyond the Standard Model seeks to unravel the unknown phenomena.

### Project Goal
- Investigate precision in the SM via the LHC's potential.
- Discover novel physics and maintain background rejection.
- Effective preprocessing(blurring and Deblurring) of the input images using autograd for accurate classification of signal and background events.
- Employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning algorithms to enhance signal efficiency.

### Background
Signal events are basically the events of interest to us. For examples, if some new particles are formed from a collision that are new and unknown to us, that would signify some new physics phenomenon that is involved so that would be a signal event. A background event is something that mimics a signal event that could come from a known physical process which we are not interested in. Our main focus is on building classification algorithms to classify a signal event image from a background event image accurately to help discover new phenomena. Till now we have worked on labelled data and build 2 algorithms for the classification- pca and cnn. And currently we are working on cnn.
